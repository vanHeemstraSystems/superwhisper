# 200 - Additional Customizations on code

One of the best parts of using Cursor AI and Superwhisper is the ability to customize how your code is written:

- **Control Imports**: If you prefer not to have Cursor automatically import libraries, you can specify that in your commands.
- **Custom Naming**: You can also control how variables are named to ensure they match your preferred coding style.
